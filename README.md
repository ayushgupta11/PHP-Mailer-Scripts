To add mailing functionality to your project:
* Add all three class files i.e., class.phpmailer, class.pop3, class.smtp to the root of your php script folder. (For your own convenience.)

* How to use the script is present in the script.php file.

* The Script will work on a live hosting server.

* Create an SMTP account in your hosting CPanel as it will be required within the script.
